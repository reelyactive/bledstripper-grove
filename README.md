bledstripper-grove
==================

Bluetooth Low Energy LED strip controller circuit board with standard Grove connectors.  Open hardware under the MIT License.


Overview
--------

The __bledstripper-grove__ combines a MDBT42Q Bluetooth Low Energy SoM and four Grove connectors that can be driven with high-amperage 5VDC power via a standard barrel connector.  It simplifies the wireless programming and control of up to four long strips of WS2813 LEDs (or equivalent).

LED Strips
----------

The __bledstripper-grove__ is designed to offer plug-and-play compatibility with [Seeed Studio's family of WS2813 LED strips](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-WS2813-RGB-LED-Strip-Waterproof-30-LED-m-1m.html) which use standard Grove connectors.  The __bledstripper-grove__ is nonetheless compatible with the family of 5VDC addressable LEDs commonly referred to as NeoPixels, strips of which can alternatively be directly soldered to the through-hole connectors of J1-J4 of the board.

Key components
--------------

The __bledstripper-grove__ comprises the following three key components:
- [Raytac's MDBT42Q-512KV2 module](https://www.raytac.com/product/ins.php?index_id=31), which is based on the Nordic nRF52832 Bluetooth Low Energy IC, and which is [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/MDBT42Q)-compatible.
- [TI's LP2985-33DBVR](https://www.ti.com/product/LP2985) 3.3V low-dropout voltage regulator to power the MDBT42Q
- [TI's TXU0104QPWRQ1](https://www.ti.com/product/TXU0104) four-channel voltage-level translator to convert the high-speed LED control signals from 3.3V to 5.0V

BOM selection was made to maximise [Shenzhen/Seeed OPL](https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html) (open parts library) components which include:

Enclosure
---------

The __bledstripper-grove__ is designed to fit the inexpensive [Hammond Manufacturing 1551K enclosure](https://www.hammfg.com/electronics/small-case/plastic/1551), which is available with or without flange, and in several colours.  Cutouts are required for the barrel connector and grove connectors.


Project History
---------------

The __bledstripper-grove__ is a collaboration between [reelyActive](https://www.reelyactive.com/) and [g√©nielab.](https://genielab.co/), with the v0.1 layout completed by [TristanFranc](https://github.com/TristanFranc/).
